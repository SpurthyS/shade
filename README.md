# Shade: Cloud Cost Advisor

## Overview
Shade is an AI-powered chatbot that helps users analyze their Google Cloud Platform (GCP) costs and provides optimization suggestions using Generative AI models. The name "Shade" comes from the idea of throwing shade on the hidden costs that your cloud instances are incurring.

## Tech Stack
- **LangChain** - For chaining LLM responses
- **LlamaIndex** - To index and query cost reports
- **Google Cloud Services:**
  - **BigQuery** - Store & query cost data
  - **Cloud Functions** - Serverless backend
  - **Vertex AI** - For LLM inference
  - **Cloud Storage** - Store logs/reports

## Features
1. **Ingest & Index Cost Data**
   - Pull data from GCP Billing API and store it in BigQuery.
   - Use LlamaIndex to index cost-related data.

2. **Chatbot Interface**
   - Users can ask questions like *"Which service is costing the most?"* or *"How can I optimize my GKE costs?"*
   - LangChain will structure responses from LlamaIndex and Googleâ€™s PaLM API (Vertex AI).

3. **Optimization Insights**
   - Use predefined heuristics and ML models to suggest cost savings (e.g., idle resources, instance rightsizing).

4. **Deploy as a Web App or Slack Bot**
   - Use Flask/FastAPI to build a simple UI or integrate with Slack for real-time insights.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shade.git
   cd shade
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up Google Cloud Services:**
   - Enable GCP Billing API, BigQuery, and Vertex AI.
   - Set up service account credentials.
   - Configure necessary IAM roles.

4. **Run the Chatbot:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for multi-cloud cost analysis (AWS, Azure).
- Implement more AI-driven cost-saving recommendations.
- Improve chatbot response accuracy with fine-tuned models.
